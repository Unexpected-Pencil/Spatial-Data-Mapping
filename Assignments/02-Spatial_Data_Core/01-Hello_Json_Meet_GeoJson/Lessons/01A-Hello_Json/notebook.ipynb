    "## Your Turn\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background \n",
    "\n",
    "- This is Your Hands On Application\n",
    "\n",
    "- The previous section code uses two different ways to load the json data so it can be used by Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First snippet takes a multiline string, and uses `json.loads` to convert it into a usable Python data structure.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. The second snippet simply uses the same syntax (for lack of a better term) which is natively how Python decodes or interprets data so that it gets represented as a Python data structure. \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. So what the hell? Json functions (see below) are used to basically convert strings to json and json back to strings. \n",
    "   | Big Deal?? Yes, strings save very well into files, and can be converted  back to a data structure quite nicely as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Sounds trivial? Well, try writing a list based binary search tree, then saving it to a file, and reloading again on demand so you rebuild the tree. Is it possible? Sure, and even easy when you know the trick, but it's by far not straight forward. \n",
    "  \n",
    "   - **BTW: Writing real data structures to a file as a string is called \"serialization\".**\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. As opposed to loading json like in 1 and 2 internally from a string or dictionary (or list) type, Go here (A really good python tutorial): https://realpython.com/python-json/ and look for the following terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `json.loads` # load a string converting to json\n",
    "- `json.dumps` # dump a data structure into a string\n",
    "- `json.load`  # load a string file into a json data structure\n",
    "- `json.dump`  # write json data structure to a specified file\n",
    "- `indent=N`   # make your json files pretty\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The above list contains the multiple ways you can read and write json from string to json or json to string or file input to json and json to file output as described above, but in a more succinct fashion.\n",
    "  \n",
    "6. Also if you noticed, when looking at the json files in this folder (`initial_dict.json` and `initial_string.json`), you would notice they are not formatted well ... all the code is on one line (unless you have plugin or something that auto formats json, and there are plugins for chrome or whatever browser to prettify json0).\n",
    "\n",
    "This txt is wrapping but there is no easily readable formatting.\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "{\"course\": \"Spatial Data & Mapping\", \"week\": 1, \"topics\": [\"json\", \"geojson\", \"files\"], \"instructor\": {\"name\": \"Terry\", \"offic ..... eol\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is an ok way to store json, as it saves a bunch of wasted space including unnecessary newlines and spaces for indentation. However you want (most of the time) to easily read your data: \n",
    "\n",
    "```json \n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"course\": \"Spatial Data & Mapping\",\n",
    "  \"week\": 1,\n",
    "  \"topics\": [\"json\", \"geojson\", \"files\"],\n",
    "  \"instructor\": {\"name\": \"Terry\", \"office\": \"Somewhere mysterious\"},\n",
    "  \"students\": [\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Ada\", \"year\": \"Sophomore\"},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Linus\", \"year\": \"Junior\"},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Grace\", \"year\": \"Senior\"}\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "There is a named keyword you can use when writing out json to make it pretty. Its a named argument called `indent` where `indent=3` does just that. The above snippet uses indent=2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### I want you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Open either json file from `./Resources/Data` and load it (just pick one).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2.  Add a new student to the students list in the opened json file. \n",
    "    - You have to use code to make it happen. Kind of like: `jData[\"students].append(?????)`\n",
    "   \n",
    "3.  Save your json file by writing it back to a file called `modified_data.json` and ensure it is saved with nice and readable indentation (aka not on the same line). \n",
    "   \n",
    "4.  Create a document (pdf) that has your small amount of code, along with the initial input file, and output file. Ensure everything is commented, and labeled clearly. \n",
    "   \n",
    "5.  Save notebook to your`Assignments Completed` folder in a the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
